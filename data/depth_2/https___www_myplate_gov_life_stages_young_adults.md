##### [**Tip Sheet**](/tip-sheet/healthy-eating-young-adults "young adults tip sheet")















Healthy Eating Tips


Pack healthy snacks, such as plain popcorn, dried fruit, whole grain crackers or nuts into small containers or baggies. They make great 'grab\-\&\-go' options on busy days.






Healthy Eating Tips


Fill reusable water bottles and store them in the fridge. When you open the fridge and see cold water, you’ll be more likely to grab it.






Healthy Eating Tips


Coordinate a ‘dinner club’ with your roommates or friends. Pick a couple nights a week where you cook healthy meals for each other. It’s a great way to try new foods and learn new skills.






Healthy Eating Tips


Living on your own? Freeze leftovers into single servings for an easy heat\-and\-eat meal.






Healthy Eating Tips


Get your [MyPlate Plan](/myplate-plan) to see what and how much to eat within your calorie allowance (including food groups).

MyPlate Tips on Alexa
---------------------


Get MyPlate nutrition information straight to your home on your Amazon Alexa smart speaker, or on your phone or tablet via the free Amazon Alexa app. For more information, visit our [MyPlate Alexa page](/myplateassistant "MyPlate Alexa").


Below are some of the many tips available for young adults. And just like the MyPlate.gov website and MyPlate tools, all of the information provided by MyPlate on Alexa is based on the [*Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020\-2025*](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/ "Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025").






### Sodium/ Salt


Spice it up! Flavor your foods with fresh or dried herbs and spices instead of salt. Pick spice blends that do not list salt or sodium on the ingredient list.






### Grains


Try to make at least half your grains whole grains. Look for sandwich breads made with whole grains. Or try a sandwich\-like bread such as pita bread, tortillas, naan, and rolls. All of these are also available as whole grains.






### Protein


Get creative with beans, peas, and lentils. Make chili or stews with kidney or pinto beans, a bowl of split pea soup for lunch or dinner, or lentils as a side dish. Check online for recipe ideas.






### Beverages


Perk up plain water or seltzer water with lemon, lime, or orange slices. Maybe even add some fresh mint leaves or a few fresh or frozen berries.






### Fats


In place of foods higher in saturated fat, look for foods like nuts, seeds, and fatty fish like tuna, salmon, trout, and mackerel. These foods are high in unsaturated fats and are healthier choices.






### Calcium


The nutrients in dairy are important for all ages. Include foods like low\-fat or fat\-free dairy milk or yogurt. Need an alternative? Try lactose\-free dairy milk or yogurt that's low\-fat or fat\-free. You can also try fortified soy versions.






### Dietary Fiber


Take fruit on the go. Fruits like oranges, bananas, and apples are great portable snacks. You can also bring along a can of mandarin oranges or pineapple chunks packed in water.






### Dairy/ Fortified Soy Alternatives


Move to low\-fat or fat\-free dairy milk or yogurt, or lactose\-free dairy or fortified soy versions.






### Healthy Eating


Take a look at your current eating routine. Pick one or two ways that you can switch to choices today that are rich in nutrition.






### Added Sugars


Share dessert with someone else. Half a pastry or slice of cake means only half the added sugars (and calories) for each of you.
