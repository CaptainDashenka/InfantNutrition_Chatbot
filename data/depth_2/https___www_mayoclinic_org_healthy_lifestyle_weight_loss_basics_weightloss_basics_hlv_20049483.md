Weight\-loss basics
-------------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


Keeping a healthy weight is a balancing act. Calories play a large part. Weight loss comes down to burning more calories than are taken in from food. Cutting calories from food and drink and burning more calories by moving more are ways to do that.


That might seem simple. But it can be hard to find a weight\-loss plan that works for you.


You don't have to do it alone. Talk to your doctor, family and friends for support. Ask yourself if now is a good time to start. Are you ready to make the needed changes? Also, plan smart. Think about how you'll handle challenges to your plan and minor setbacks.


For people who have serious health problems linked to weight, a doctor might suggest surgery or medicines to help with weight loss. If you're considering either, talk to your doctor about the possible benefits and risks.


But don't forget the bottom line: The key to losing weight and keeping it off is changing diet and exercise habits for the long haul.
