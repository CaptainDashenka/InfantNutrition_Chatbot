Make healthy choices as you grow.
---------------------------------


During the teenage years, you’re beginning to make your own decisions – and that’s pretty awesome! One of the ways you can make smart choices is in the foods you eat. We get it, life is busy between school and friends, but starting with small changes now will not only help keep your mind and body growing healthy, but it will also help set you up for success later on.

##### [**Tip Sheet**](/tip-sheet/healthy-eating-teens "teens tip sheet")














### Learn What You Need


Do you know what foods and amounts are best for YOU? Get your personalized [MyPlate Plan](/myplate-plan "MyPlate Plan ") to learn your food group goals. 


Before making any major changes to the way you eat, make sure to talk with a parent, caregiver, or a healthcare provider.

### Eat a Variety of Foods


Make choices from all food groups—fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives—every day. Each group gives you different nutrients and you need all of them.


Eating a variety of healthy foods can have many benefits, including more energy, stronger bones, and healthier skin.

##### Make Healthy Choices on the Go


Life is busy and you may not always be home when hunger strikes. If you have afterschool activities or work, stock your backpack with healthy snacks like apples, baby carrots, whole wheat crackers, or unsalted nuts. Check out [Healthy Snacking with MyPlate](/tip-sheet/healthy-snacking-myplate "Healthy Snacking with MyPlate") for more ideas.

##### Explore Ideas in the Kitchen


Now is a great time to start learning how to do more on your own in the kitchen. Keep it fun by inviting a friend over to try a recipe together. Check out [MyPlate Kitchen](/myplate-kitchen "MyPlate Kitchen") for lots of great ideas. Even if your first attempt is a fail, it can make for a good story! Share photos of your creations with friends and family.















### Keep Water Handy


Water is a healthy and refreshing drink choice. Keep a reusable water bottle in your bag and skip the sugary sodas, fruit drinks, coffee drinks, and energy and sports drinks.


For something different, try flavoring water with fruits or vegetables (like lemons, oranges, or cucumbers), and mint or other herbs. Check out other ways to [make better beverage choices](/tip-sheet/make-better-beverage-choices "make better beverage choices").

### Be Active


Squeeze in some physical activity between homework, going out, and other activities. Here are some ideas:


* Try morning stretches or yoga
* Walk the dog
* Ride your bike or skateboard with a friend
* Do an online workout or dance video
* Sign up for an active after\-school program or rec center class
* Put on your favorite podcast or playlist and go for a walk or run
* Organize a pick\-up soccer, basketball, or kickball game with friends














MyPlate Tips on Alexa
---------------------


Get MyPlate nutrition information straight to your home on your Amazon Alexa smart speaker, or on your phone or tablet via the free Amazon Alexa app. For more information, visit our [MyPlate Alexa page](/myplateassistant "MyPlate Alexa page").


Below are some of the many tips available for teens and their parents and caregivers. And just like the MyPlate.gov website and MyPlate tools, all of the information provided by MyPlate on Alexa is based on the [*Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020\-2025*](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/ "Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025").






### Beverages


Perk up plain water or seltzer water with lemon, lime, or orange slices. Maybe even add some fresh mint leaves or a few fresh or frozen berries.






### Healthy Eating


Take a look at your current eating routine. Pick one or two ways that you can switch to choices today that are rich in nutrition..






### Sodium/ Salt


Go easy on the sauce. Be mindful of how much sauce, gravy, salsa, ketchup, soy sauce, marinade, or dressing you're using. The sodium from these can add up quickly.






### Protein


Enjoy a healthy snack of raw veggies and hummus. Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip made from blended chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans. Hummus is rich in protein, dietary fiber, and several important minerals.






### Calcium


If you skip dairy, get calcium from fortified products like soy beverages, tofu, and some breakfast cereals and orange juices. Dark\-green leafy vegetables like collard greens, spinach, and kale are sources of calcium, too..






### Added Sugars


Pick lower\-sugar options. Choose packaged foods that have less or no added sugars such as plain low\-fat or fat\-free yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, or canned fruit packed in its own juice or water.






### Dietary Fiber


Take fruit on the go. Fruits like oranges, bananas, and apples are great portable snacks. You can also bring along a can of mandarin oranges or pineapple chunks packed in water..






### Grains


Switch up pizza night. Create individual, homemade pizzas on whole\-wheat English muffins or tortillas. Or, make a traditional pizza using a pre\-made whole\-wheat flour. Don’t forget the veggie toppings.






### Dairy/ Fortified Soy Alternatives


Move to low\-fat or fat\-free dairy milk or yogurt, or lactose\-free dairy or fortified soy versions.






### Fats


In place of foods higher in saturated fat, look for foods like nuts, seeds, and fatty fish like tuna, salmon, trout, and mackerel. These foods are high in unsaturated fats and are healthier choices.
