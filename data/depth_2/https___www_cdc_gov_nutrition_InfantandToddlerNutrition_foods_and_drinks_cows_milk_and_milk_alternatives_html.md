Your growing child needs vitamins and minerals like vitamin D and calcium to build strong bones. Pasteurized, whole cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk and soy beverages that have been [fortified](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#fortified) with vitamin D are good sources of vitamin D and calcium. Most cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk sold in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.


Choose milk or milk alternatives that are unflavored and unsweetened. Flavored cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk and fortified soy beverages can have added sugars. Your child does not need added sugars.


When Should I Introduce My Child to CowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs Milk?
-----------------------------------------------


At 12 months old (but not before), your child can be introduced to cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk. Before your child is 12 months old, cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk may put him or her at risk for intestinal bleeding. It also has too many proteins and minerals for your babyaÌ‚â‚¬TMs kidneys to handle and does not have the right amount of nutrients your baby needs.

How Much, and How Often?
------------------------


CowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk or fortified soy beverages can be a part of a childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs balanced and diverse diet but not the only thing. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend children aged 12 through 23 months get 12aÌ‚ï¿1⁄2â€ž3 to 2 cup equivalents of dairy a day, including cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages, and soy\-based yogurt. If your child drinks too much cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk, he or she may not be hungry for other foods with important nutrients. Some experts say that consuming too much cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk can make it harder for your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs body to absorb the iron he or she needs from foods.


Continue to follow your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs cues to decide when he or she is hungry or full. Talk with your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs doctor or nurse for more questions about adding cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk or fortified soy beverages in his or her diet.


Whole CowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs Milk or Lower Fat CowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs Milk?
-----------------------------------------


Children can drink unflavored, unsweetened whole cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk. Whole cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk is the same as lower fat cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk except that it is higher in fat. It is important for young children to get fat in their diet for healthy growth and development. If your child has excessive weight gain or a family history of obesity, high cholesterol or triglycerides, or cardiovascular disease, talk to your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs doctor or nurse about the type of cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk to give.


Raw Milk
--------


Raw milk and raw milk products from cows, goats, and sheep can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make your child very sick and can be life\-threatening. Raw milk can also be called unpasteurized milk. Do not give your child raw or unpasteurized milk.


Milk Alternatives
-----------------


Milk alternatives can include beverages made from plants, such as soy, oat, rice, coconut, cashew, and almond.


If you choose a milk alternative, here are things to remember:


* Milk alternatives should not be given before 12 months.
* Fortified soy beverages are the only milk alternative that help meet a childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs recommended dairy needs.
* Choose one that is unflavored and unsweetened. Your child does not need added sugars.
* Choose one that is fortified with vitamin D and calcium. Check labels, since nutrient content can vary between brands.
* Talk with your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs doctor or nurse about the milk alternative you are using, because the vitamins and minerals in these types of milks are different than in cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk.
