**When your child is between 6 and 12 months, some types of foods and drinks are better for your child than others.**


To learn more, watch these [videos](/nutrition/InfantandToddlerNutrition/resources.html#videos) from 1,000 Days.



Healthy eating patterns your child starts now will help promote healthy habits in the future. It is important to provide foods that match your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs eating skills. At first, foods may need to be soft and mashed or bite\-sized. Visit [Tastes and Textures](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/foods-and-drinks/tastes-and-textures.html) for more information.


Encourage Your Child to Eat
---------------------------


Offer your child a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, meats, and yogurt or cheeses. Make a rainbow of different colored foods on your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs plate. Here are a few examples:


* **Fruits:** bananas, strawberries, pears, oranges, melons, or avocados.
* **Vegetables:** cooked spinach, carrots, beans, peas, lentils, yams, or beets.
* **Whole grains:** whole grain breads, crackers, or pastas.
* **Proteins:** soft, small pieces of beef, lamb, chicken, fish, turkey, eggs, or tofu.
* **Dairy:** pasteurized cheeses or yogurts, including soy\-based yogurt.


Once your child is 12 months old, he or she may be eating more of the foods that you eat. Eating a healthy diet sets a good example for your toddler. Continue to offer a variety of healthy options and allow your child to choose foods to eat.


Encourage Your Child to Drink
-----------------------------


When your child is between 6 and 12 months old, you can offer your child:


* **Water** (4 to 8 ounces per day).
* **Breast milk** (if you are still breastfeeding) or **infant formula**.


Once your child is 12 months old, you can begin offering plain whole cowaÌ‚â‚¬TMs milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverages. Starting at 24 months old, move to low\-fat (1%) or fat\-free dairy milk.


For ideas on different meals or snacks for your child, visit the [USDAaÌ‚â‚¬TMs MyPlate Recipes](https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-kitchen/recipes) page.
