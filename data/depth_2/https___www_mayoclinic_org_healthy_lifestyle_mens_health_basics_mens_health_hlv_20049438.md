Men's health
------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


Do you know the biggest threats to men's health? Heart disease and cancer top the list. Others include injury, lung disease, stroke and diabetes. Although you may not be able to prevent all of these, some can be prevented. Healthy lifestyle choices, such as eating a healthy diet and moving every day, can help.


To protect your health, avoid risky actions, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol and having casual sex.


And take steps to keep yourself safe. Use a seat belt when in a car. Wear a helmet when on a bike or motorcycle. Use a safety ladder to reach high areas. Manage illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Practice safer sex. Get all the suggested health screenings and vaccinations for your age.


Keep in mind, too, that health issues can change with age. For example, many men gain weight as they get older. Is that a health problem? It can be, especially if the extra weight is in the form of belly fat.


As you age, you also may wonder about other topics. For example, is male menopause a myth or real? Testosterone levels start going down after age 40\. This can affect wanting to have sex and being able to have sex. Could testosterone therapy help?


Get answers to these and other men's health questions.
