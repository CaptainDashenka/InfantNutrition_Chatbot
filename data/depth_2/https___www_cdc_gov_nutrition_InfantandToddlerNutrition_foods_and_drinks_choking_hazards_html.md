Did You Know?**You can help prevent your child from choking.**


To learn more, watch these [videos](/nutrition/InfantandToddlerNutrition/resources.html#videos) from 1,000 Days.



Your baby is learning how to chew and swallow foods. This means your child may choke. By 12 months old, your child is getting better at eating and may even be feeding themselves. Even though your child can now eat most foods, some are still choking hazards. The way food is prepared may increase the risk for choking. For example, some foods that are served uncooked, whole, or in certain shapes or sizes can be choking hazards. Cutting up food into smaller pieces and mashing foods can help prevent choking.


Here are ways to help prevent your child from choking.


Foods and preparation


* Cook and prepare food to the right shape, size, and texture [for your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs development](/nutrition/InfantandToddlerNutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-to-introduce-solid-foods.html).
* Avoid small, sticky, or hard foods that are hard to chew and swallow.


Meals and snacktime


* Have your child sit up while eating (no lying down, crawling, or walking).
* Have your child sit in a high chair or other safe place.
* Avoid letting your child eat in the car or stroller.
* Keep mealtimes calm. Avoid distractions, disruptions, and rushing when eating.


Always


* Pay close attention to what your child puts in his or her mouth.
* Watch your child at all times while he or she is eating.


Be ready


* Talk to your childaÌ‚â‚¬TMs doctor or nurse to learn what to do if your child chokes.
