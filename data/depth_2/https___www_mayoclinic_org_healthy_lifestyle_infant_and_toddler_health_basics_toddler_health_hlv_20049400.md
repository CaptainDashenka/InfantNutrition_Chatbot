Toddler health
--------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


Toddlers are always moving and exploring. That's why child safety is so important. At this stage, parents are often looking for ways to keep toddlers safe from falls, burns, cuts and other dangers.


Another health concern is the dreaded toddler tantrum. Toddlers can't always say what they want or need, which is frustrating to them. So they sometimes have temper tantrums. Find out how you can help your toddler through this stage. For example, teaching your toddler some basic sign language might be of use.


Toddler health is filled with turning points, such as potty training. Know when it's time to begin potty training. And if your child isn't ready, know when it's time to stop for a while.


As always, your child's health care professional can answer many questions about toddler health. Know what to expect from your toddler, and what health issues can become problems.
