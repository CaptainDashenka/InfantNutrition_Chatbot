Sexual health basics
--------------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


Sex is part of being human. Love and feelings of closeness play a role in healthy relationships from childhood through old age.


Sexual health is as important as physical, mental and spiritual health. Being sexually healthy allows for:


* Having healthy relationships.
* Planning pregnancies.
* Preventing diseases.


It's vital to know about sexual health and what it takes to have a good sex life. And it's just as important to be aware of what causes problems in sexual health. Don't let being uneasy keep you from bringing up worries or questions with a member of your health care team.
