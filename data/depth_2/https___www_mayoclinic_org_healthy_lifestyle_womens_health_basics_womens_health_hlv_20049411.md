Women's health
--------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


When thinking about women's health, there's a lot to consider. Knowing the diseases and conditions that are among the top health risks for women, such as heart disease and breast cancer, is important. But for many women, effectively managing other matters that affect daily health, such as premenstrual syndrome, birth control, fertility, menopause and more, also is key to enjoying a vibrant life.


One topic that often raises many questions is breast health. What does it mean if you have dense breast tissue? What should you do if you find a breast lump? Is breast pain a cause for concern?


And as you get older, your health concerns are likely to change. Could belly fat lead to health problems? Are Kegel exercises really necessary? What's the best way to deal with the changes of menopause?


No matter what your age, lifestyle choices can go a long way toward lowering health risks and helping you live the life you want. Exercise and fitness coupled with a healthy diet can make a big difference in your health.
