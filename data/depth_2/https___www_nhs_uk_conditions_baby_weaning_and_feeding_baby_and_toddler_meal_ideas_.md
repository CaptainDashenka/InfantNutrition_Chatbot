Baby and toddler meal ideas
===========================








If you need some inspiration to help you cook healthy and tasty food for your child, try these meal ideas.

These are not suitable as first foods but are fine once your baby is used to eating a wide range of solid foods. [Read more about your baby's first solid foods](/conditions/baby/weaning-and-feeding/babys-first-solid-foods/).

When preparing food for babies, do not add sugar or salt (including stock cubes and gravy) directly to the food or to the cooking water.

Full\-fat cheese, yoghurt and fromage frais are recommended up to the age of 2 years. But it’s ok to give lower fat options over the age of 2\.

* minced chicken and vegetable casserole with mashed potato

Finger foods for babies and young children
------------------------------------------


Finger food is food that's cut up into pieces big enough for your child to hold in their fist with a bit sticking out. Pieces about the size of your own finger work well.

Examples of finger foods:

* soft\-cooked vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, courgette, parsnip and sweet potato
* carrot or cucumber sticks and avocado
* fresh fruits, such as apple (soft\-cooked if needed), banana or soft, ripe peeled pear or peach
* toast, pitta or chapatti fingers
* unsalted and unsweetened rice or corn cakes
* strips of meat without bones, such as chicken and lamb
* cheese on toast fingers, made with cheese, and cucumber
* hard boiled eggs
* omelette fingers




Healthy snacks for young children
---------------------------------


Babies under 12 months do not need snacks; if you think your baby is hungry in between meals, offer extra milk feeds instead.

Once your baby is 1 year old, you can introduce 2 healthy snacks in between meals. For example:

* vegetables, such as broccoli florets, carrot sticks or cucumber sticks
* slices of fruit, such as apple, banana or soft, ripe peeled pear or peach
* pasteurised, plain, unsweetened yoghurt
* toast, pitta or chapatti fingers
* unsalted and unsweetened rice or corn cakes
* small strips of cheese




Getting your child to eat fruit and vegetables
----------------------------------------------


It may take up to 10 tries, or even more, for your child to get used to new foods, flavour and textures.

Be patient and keep offering a variety of fruits and vegetables, including ones with bitter flavours, such as broccoli, cauliflower, spinach and cabbage.

Try to make sure fruits and vegetables are included in every meal.

To help your child eat more fruit and vegetables:

* give carrot sticks, cucumber sticks or slices of pepper with hummus as a snack
* give apple slices with smooth peanut butter as a snack
* mix chopped or mashed vegetables with rice, mashed potatoes, meat sauces or dhal
* add vegetables to classic savoury dishes such as cottage or shepherd's pie, spaghetti bolognese or casseroles
* chop prunes or dried apricots into cereal or plain, unsweetened yoghurt, or add them to a stew
* for a tasty dessert, try mixing fruit (fresh, canned or stewed) with plain, unsweetened yoghurt
