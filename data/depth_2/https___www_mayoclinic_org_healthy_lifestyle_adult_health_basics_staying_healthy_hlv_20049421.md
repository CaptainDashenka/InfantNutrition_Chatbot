Maintaining good health
-----------------------

[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)


When you think of adult health, you may think about ways to stay healthy. They might include doing all you can to prevent cancer, getting vaccines, and washing your hands well and often. That's a good start. The choices you make every day go a long way toward better adult health.


It's just as important to take note when you have symptoms too. Know when to see a health care professional. Serious symptoms might include weight loss for no known reason, changes in bowel habits, shortness of breath or sudden headaches.


And of course, regular physical exams and screening tests are an important part of staying healthy. Learn which screening tests you need and how often to have them. Finding a condition early could be the key to successfully treating it.
