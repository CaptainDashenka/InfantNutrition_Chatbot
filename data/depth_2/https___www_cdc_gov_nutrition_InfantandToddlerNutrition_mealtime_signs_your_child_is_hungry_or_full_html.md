Even before your child can talk, he or she will show signs of hunger or fullness by using sounds and movements. Crying is often a late sign of hunger. Look for other signs of hunger listed below so you can put your child to the breast or bottle while he or she is still calm. As your child gets older, he or she will develop new signs for hunger and fullness. Understanding your child’s signs is important to help you know when and how often to feed your child.


Below are some examples of signs your child may show for hunger and fullness when he or she is a newborn to 5 months old and signs your child may start to show between 6 to 23 months old:


Birth to 5 Months Old
---------------------

Your child may be **hungry** if he or she:


* Puts hands to mouth.
* Turns head towards breast or bottle.
* Puckers, smacks, or licks lips.
* Has clenched hands.

Your child may be **hungry** if he or she:


* Reaches for or points to food.
* Opens his or her mouth when offered a spoon or food.
* Gets excited when he or she sees food.
* Uses hand motions or makes sounds to let you know he or she is still hungry.


![An 18-month old leaning away from her mother and the offered food.](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/images/signs-hungry-full-4.jpg?_=76989 "signs-hungry-full-4.jpg")
Your child may be **full** if he or she:


* Pushes food away.
* Closes his or her mouth when food is offered.
* Turns his or her head away from food.
* Uses hand motions or makes sounds to let you know he or she is full.


Let your child decide how much he or she wants. Your child does not need to finish a bottle or all of the food in the jar or on the plate. Food is not a good reward or punishment.


Talk to your child’s doctor or nurse if you are concerned about how much or how little he or she is eating.
