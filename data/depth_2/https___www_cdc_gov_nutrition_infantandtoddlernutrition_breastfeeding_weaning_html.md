At some point, either you or your child will be ready to stop breastfeeding. Weaning from breastfeeding is the process of switching a baby’s diet from breast milk to other foods and drinks. Read on to learn more about when and how to wean.


When to Wean
------------


When to wean is a personal decision and will be different for everyone. Each child may be ready to wean, or stop breastfeeding, at different ages. Some children will gradually start to show more interest in eating solid foods and less interest in breastfeeding. Others may want to stop breastfeeding more suddenly. You may be ready to wean at different times too. This is a personal decision.


If you and your child have decided it is time to wean and your child is ***younger than* 12 months old…**


* Give your child infant formula in place of breast milk.


If you and your child have decided it is time to wean and your child is **12 months *or older*…**


* Give your child plain whole cow’s milk or [fortified](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#fortified)  unsweetened soy beverage in place of breast milk. He or she does not need infant formula or toddler milks, drinks, or formula.

How to Wean
-----------


To make the process easier for you and your child, wean over several weeks or more. As you slowly stop breastfeeding, your body will start producing less breast milk and eventually your body will no longer make breast milk.


Weaning gradually can help your child…


* Get used to the new taste of infant formula (for your child younger than 12 months old) or plain whole cow’s milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage (for your child 12 months or older).
* Adjust to drinking from a bottle or cup.


Start weaning by replacing one breast milk feeding a day with a bottle of infant formula (for your child younger than 12 months old) or with a cup of plain whole cow’s milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage (for your child 12 months or older). Continue to replace more breast milk feedings over time.
