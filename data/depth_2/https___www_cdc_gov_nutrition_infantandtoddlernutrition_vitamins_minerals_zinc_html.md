What Does Zinc Do?
------------------


![A child eating from a spoon](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/images/zinc-500px.jpg?_=90181)
Children need zinc to grow and develop. Zinc is a mineral that is important for immune function, wound healing, and the senses of smell and taste.


When Does My Child Need Zinc? And How Much?
-------------------------------------------


Zinc is important at all stages of your child’s development. When your child is about 6 months old, you can start giving solid foods with zinc to your child.  

Children 7 to 24 months need 3 mg of zinc each day.


Once My Child Starts to Eat Solid Foods, How Can I Make Sure My Child Gets Enough Zinc?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


It is important to choose foods that contain zinc. Examples of foods with zinc include:


* [Zinc\-fortified](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#fortified) grains (for example, zinc\-fortified infant cereals)
* Meats (for example, beef or pork)
* Dairy (for example, yogurt or cheese)
* [Fish](https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish) (for example, flounder)
* Shellfish (for example, oysters or crab)
* Legumes (for example, beans)


Foods with zinc are especially important for babies who are fed **only** **breast milk**. Levels of zinc in breast milk are high after birth and go down over the first 6 months. After 6 months, it is important to introduce foods with zinc to meet nutritional needs.
