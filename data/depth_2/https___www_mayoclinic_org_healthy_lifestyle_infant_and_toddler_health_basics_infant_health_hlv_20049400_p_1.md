### Infant and toddler health

New parents and those who've had children for a while often have questions about infant and toddler health. Which vaccines do children need? What's the best way to take a child's temperature? What happens at well\-child exams? What's the latest in infant and toddler health?


The more parents know about infant and toddler health, the more at ease they can feel caring for their children. If you have questions about your child's health, start by asking your child's health care professional. Remember, nothing is too small when it comes to your child's health.


Find out how to reach your child's health professional between visits. Questions about infant and toddler health can come up at any time. Knowing how to get help can help ease your mind.

### Newborn health

Having a newborn brings a whole new level of activity to your life. At first, newborn care might seem to be only round\-the\-clock feeding, bathing, diapering and soothing. But there's more to keeping a newborn healthy. There's also caring for a newborn's skin, knowing what a newborn's cries mean and helping a newborn to develop.


Taking good care of a newborn also means caring for yourself. Get as much sleep as you can when you can. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need a break.


Newborn care can turn parents' lives upside down. Worry about newborn health can seem constant. But it can help to focus on the joy having a newborn brings to life, and taking everything else one day at a time.

### Infant health

Babies seem to learn something new every day. And in fact, everything in babies' lives helps them learn more about their world. That includes cuddling before nap time and watching and listening to people around them.


As babies grow and change, parents often have new questions about infant health. How do I get a baby to sleep through the night? When do I give a baby solid food? When will a baby sit up? What are signs that a baby might be sick?


There are many ways to learn about infant health. Talk to your baby's health care professional. Use other sources, such as a phone number staffed by health professionals. Trust your gut, too. And know that timing is key to an infant's health. The earlier problems are found, the sooner treatment can begin.

### Toddler health

Toddlers are always moving and exploring. That's why child safety is so important. At this stage, parents are often looking for ways to keep toddlers safe from falls, burns, cuts and other dangers.


Another health concern is the dreaded toddler tantrum. Toddlers can't always say what they want or need, which is frustrating to them. So they sometimes have temper tantrums. Find out how you can help your toddler through this stage. For example, teaching your toddler some basic sign language might be of use.


Toddler health is filled with turning points, such as potty training. Know when it's time to begin potty training. And if your child isn't ready, know when it's time to stop for a while.


As always, your child's health care professional can answer many questions about toddler health. Know what to expect from your toddler, and what health issues can become problems.
