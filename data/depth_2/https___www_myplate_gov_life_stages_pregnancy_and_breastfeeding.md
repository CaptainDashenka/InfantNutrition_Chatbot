##### [**Tip Sheet**](/tip-sheet/healthy-eating-women-who-are-pregnant-or-breastfeeding "pregnancy and breastfeeding tip sheet")















### Eat Healthy


* Healthy choices include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein foods, and low\-fat or fat\-free dairy milk or yogurt (or lactose\-free dairy or fortified soy versions).
* Include a variety of protein foods such as seafood, lean meats, poultry, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, and eggs.
* Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.


**Should I eat seafood during pregnancy?**  

Eating seafood during pregnancy may help your baby's growth. Seafood is a healthy protein source for you during pregnancy and while breastfeeding/ lactating. Choose options lower in methylmercury, like cod, salmon, tilapia, or herring. 


Learn more at FDA’s [Advice About Eating Fish](https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/advice-about-eating-fish "Advice about Eating Fish") webpage.

 ![myplate plan](https://myplate-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2020-12/pregnancy-breastfeeding-myplateplan-iphone-graphic.jpg?itok=3D_oLFwj)






### Get Your Plan


You may have different calorie needs during pregnancy and while breastfeeding/ lactating. Get your [MyPlate Plan](/myplate-plan "MyPlate Plan") to learn how many calories you may need. Work closely with your healthcare provider to learn the right eating plan for you.















### Ask About Supplements


In addition to eating a healthy diet, your doctor may want you to take a prenatal supplement. This is to make sure you get enough of the vitamins and minerals that you need for a healthy pregnancy.  


After pregnancy, your need for some vitamins and minerals may decrease. Your doctor may advise you to switch to a multivitamin supplement while breastfeeding/ lactating. Talk to your healthcare provider about what is right for you.

### Make Safe Choices


* **Food Safety During Pregnancy**  

 You and your unborn child are at greater risk for the effects of foodborne illness (also called food poisoning). Keep food safe and follow safe food handling and cooking practices to lower your chance of getting a foodborne illness.
	+ Make sure that seafood, meat, poultry, or eggs have been cooked to the recommended safe internal temperatures. [See this guidance from the FDA on safe food handling and safe minimum internal temperatures](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/safe-food-handling "Safe Food Handling").
	+ Avoid eating or drinking these items:
		- Unpasteurized (raw) juice or milk
		- Raw sprouts
		- Some soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk
	+ Reheat deli and luncheon meats and hot dogs to steaming hot or 165 °F.
	+ More information is available at CDC's [Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Nutrition](https://www.cdc.gov/grand-rounds/pp/2019/20190618-early-childhood-nutrition.html "Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Nutrition — The Thousand Day Window of Opportunity") webpage.
* **Food Allergies in Your Child**  

 Unless advised by your doctor, you do not have to restrict your food and drink choices during pregnancy or while breastfeeding/ lactating to keep your child from getting food allergies.
* **Alcohol**  

 Pregnant women and women who may become pregnant should not drink alcohol. Drinks that have alcohol include beer, wine, liquor, mixed drinks, and malt beverages. No amount of alcohol is safe for your baby when you are pregnant. Talk with your doctor if you are thinking about drinking alcohol while you are breastfeeding/ lactating.
* **Caffeine**  

 Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and soda. Ask your healthcare provider about having caffeine during pregnancy and while you are breastfeeding/ lactating.
