General Nutrition
-----------------




Why is good nutrition important for young children?



Good nutrition is important for young children for brain development and to help them grow healthy and strong.


Nutrition needs change during early childhood. For example, exclusive breast milk is the recommended source of nutrition for babies for about 6 months of life. As children grow older their nutrient needs increase. Feeding solid foods, in addition to breast milk or infant formula, helps to meet these needs.


Preterm infants, in particular infants with a very low birthweight, may require a diet higher in calories for adequate growth. This may be achieved through fortification of breast milk, pasteurized donor human milk, or preterm infant formula.


Caregivers of infants should consult with their healthcare provider about infant nutritional needs.

Important Vitamins and Minerals
-------------------------------




Why does my child need vitamin D? Can he/she get enough vitamin D from sunlight?



[Vitamin D](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/vitamins-minerals/vitamin-d.html) is needed to support healthy bone development and to prevent rickets, a condition that causes weak bones. Vitamin D deficiency rickets is rare, but it can occur if your child does not receive additional vitamin D from his or her diet, a vitamin supplement, or from adequate exposure to sunlight.[The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends keeping babies younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight and protecting them with clothing and hats to decrease their risk of skin cancer.](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/should-you-put-sunscreen-infants-not-usually)


Sunlight is not a consistent source of vitamin D, and there are a number of factors that determine the amount of vitamin D a child will synthesize from sunlight.  Factors that interfere with vitamin D production include:


* Living at high latitudes (closer to the Polar Regions), particularly during winter months.
* Air quality conditions: high levels of air pollution.
* Weather conditions: dense cloud covering.
* The degree to which clothing covers the skin.
* Use of sunscreen.
* Skin pigmentation: darker skin types.


Talk with your child’s doctor or nurse if you would like help making sure your child is getting enough vitamin D.

Emergency Preparedness
----------------------




Are there certain precautions I should take when feeding my child after a natural disaster?



In the event of a natural disaster, be prepared for challenges, which may include power outages, unhealthy living spaces, and unsafe water. Always check with local authorities on the status of the drinking water and follow boil water advisories. Learn more about how to [feed your child safely after a natural disaster](/breastfeeding/recommendations/food-safety-for-infants-after-a-disaster.html), [common questions about infant feeding during emergencies,](/nutrition/emergencies-infant-feeding/faqs.html) [special considerations](/nutrition/emergencies-infant-feeding/special-considerations.html), and [how to be prepared](/nutrition/emergencies-infant-feeding/checklist.html) for an emergency.

Breastfeeding
-------------




Is it safe for mothers to use medications while breastfeeding?



Although many medications do pass into breast milk, most have no effect on your breast milk supply or on your baby’s well\-being.


You can search for more information about a specific medication at [LactMed®](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/). Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have questions or concerns about taking medications while breastfeeding.


Visit CDC’s [Breastfeeding Prescription Medication Use](/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/vaccinations-medications-drugs/prescription-medication-use.html) page to learn more.





If I am breastfeeding, can I give my baby a pacifier?



If you are breastfeeding your baby, you may want to wait to use a pacifier until breastfeeding is well\-established. At that time, using a pacifier for naps and at bedtime can help reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).





Can toddlers be breastfed?



Yes. Breastfeeding is great for toddlers too. The [U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans  \[PDF\-30\.6MB]](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=65) recommend that infants be [exclusively breastfed](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#Exclusivebreastfeeding) for about the first 6 months, and then continuing breastfeeding while introducing appropriate [complementary foods](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#complementaryfoods) until your child is 12 months old or older. The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/1/e2022057988/188347/Policy-Statement-Breastfeeding-and-the-Use-of?searchresult=1?autologincheck=redirected) and the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/breastfeeding) also recommend exclusive breastfeeding for about the first 6 months, with continued breastfeeding along with introducing appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years of age or longer.





How much do I feed my baby if he or she is getting both breast milk and infant formula?



For babies who are receiving both breast milk and infant formula, how much and how often a baby eats may be different than for babies who receive only breast milk or only infant formula. If you have questions about your baby’s feeding patterns, talk with his or her doctor or nurse.





How do I know my newborn is getting enough to eat?



There are several ways you can tell if your baby is getting enough to eat. Having regular wet and dirty diapers are signs your baby is eating enough. In addition, your child’s doctor or nurse can check his or her weight and length to make sure he or she is [growing well](/growthcharts/index.htm). These measurements are usually done at the well\-baby visits. If you have questions about your baby’s growth, talk to his or her doctor or nurse.





Have other breastfeeding questions?



If you are interested in learning more about how growth is assessed for breastfed babies, how to continue to provide breast milk after returning to work or school, or which rights are available for breastfeeding mothers and more, learn [answers to frequently asked breastfeeding questions](/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm).

Introducing Solid Foods
-----------------------




Will putting cereal in a bottle help my baby sleep longer?



No, putting infant cereal or other solid foods in your baby’s bottle will not make him or her sleep longer and could increase your baby’s risk of choking.





When can I introduce solid foods to my baby?



The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that children be introduced to [complementary foods](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/definitions.html#complementaryfoods) around 6 months of age or when the child is developmentally ready.





How do I know my baby is *developmentally ready* for solid foods?



Here are a few key signs to look for to help determine if your baby is ready for solid foods:


If you notice your baby:


* Sits up alone or with support.
* Is able to control head and neck.
* Opens the mouth when food is offered.
* Swallows food rather than pushes it back out onto the chin.
* Brings objects to the mouth.
* Tries to grasp small objects, such as toys or food.
* Transfers food from the front to the back of the tongue to swallow.


Have concerns about your child’s developmental milestones? Learn more about [talking to your child’s doctor and sharing your concerns](/ncbddd/actearly/concerned.html).





What solid foods should my baby eat first?



The American Academy of Pediatrics says that for most children, you do not need to give foods in a certain order. Your child can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months old. By the time he or she is 7 or 8 months old, your child can eat a variety of foods from different food groups. These foods include infant cereals, meat or other proteins, fruits, vegetables, grains, yogurts and cheeses, and more.





How long do I wait between introducing new foods to my child?



The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you start by introducing one food at a time and waiting 3 to 5 days between each new food. This helps you see how your child reacts to a new food.

Foods and Drinks for My Child
-----------------------------




Do I need to worry about arsenic in my infant cereal?



If your child is eating infant cereals, it is important to offer a variety of infant cereals such as oat, barley, and multi\-grain instead of only rice cereal. Only providing infant rice cereal is not recommended by the Food and Drug Administration because there is a risk for babies to be exposed to arsenic.


Visit the [U.S. Food \& Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm493677.htm) to learn more.





Are there any tips for picky eaters or helping my child try new foods?



It can be hard for your child to try new foods. Do not be discouraged if your child does not like a new food on the first try, or even the second or third. It may take time to get used to some foods. Babies may need to try some foods more than 10 times before they like them. We have some great [tips to help you now](/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/foods-and-drinks/picky-eaters.html).





What is the difference between 100% juice and other juices?



100% juice means that the juice comes directly from fruits and/or vegetables. 100% juice does not have added sugars. Check the Nutrition Facts Labels and ingredients list to make sure it is 100% juice. Drinks labeled as juice drinks, fruit drinks, and fruit\-flavored drinks have added sugars and should be avoided.


Babies younger than 12 months should not have any juice. Children older than 12 months can have 4 ounces or less of 100% juice a day.





Should my child eat fish?



Fish provide key nutrients that support a child’s brain development and immune system. Once your child starts eating solid foods, you can introduce fish as one of those foods. Fish contain an element called mercury, and it is important to choose fish that are lower in mercury. Mercury can be harmful to your baby’s brain development. For more information on the best choices of fish, see the [FDA and EPA’s Advice About Eating Fish](https://www.fda.gov/media/152848/download).
